        <p>Five days on the freeway <br />
            Riding shotgun with you (yeah, yeah) <br />
            Two hearts in the fast lane <br />
            We had big dreams in blue (yeah, yeah)</p>

        <p>Playing Sweet Child O' Mine <br />
            And I still feel that line <br />
            Where are you now? <br />
            Where are you now?</p>

        <p> Hey, it's been too long <br />
            Too long to go, my love <br />
            Where did we go wrong? <br />
            Too late to turn around <br />
            Where are you now? <br />
            Where are you now? <br />
            Hey, it's been too long</p>

        <p> Some days I can feel it <br />
            But the feeling ain't all blue <br />
            You got me believing <br />
            One day you gotta come through <br />
            Lost in these city lights <br />
            'Cause I can't sleep tonight <br />
            Where are you now? <br />
            Where are you now?</p>
