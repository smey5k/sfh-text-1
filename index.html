            Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head</p>

        <p>Five days on the freeway <br />
            Riding shotgun with you (yeah, yeah) <br />
            Two hearts in the fast lane <br />
            We had big dreams in blue (yeah, yeah)</p>

        <p>Playing Sweet Child O' Mine <br />
            And I still feel that line <br />
            Where are you now? <br />
            Where are you now?</p>

        <p> Hey, it's been too long <br />
            Too long to go, my love <br />
            Where did we go wrong? <br />
            Too late to turn around <br />
            Where are you now? <br />

        <p> Some days I can feel it <br />
            But the feeling ain't all blue <br />
            You got me believing <br />
            One day you gotta come through <br />
            Lost in these city lights <br />
            'Cause I can't sleep tonight <br />
            Where are you now? <br />
            Where are you now?</p>

        <p><strong>David Guetta, Galantis, Little Mix</strong></p>
        <p> Hello, it's me, your ex <br />
            I called to say not sorry, but I wish you the best <br />
            And I don't hold no grudges, promise this ain't a test <br />
            We okay, we okay</p>

        <p>Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don't <br />
            Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't <br />
            Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone <br />
            Until you find home</p>

        <p>This ain't a heartbreak anthem <br />
            I don't care what happened <br />
            But I ain't got no time to dwell on it <br />
            Don't wanna throw a tantrum <br />
            You did what you had to <br />
            No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it <br />
            And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow <br />
            Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows <br />
            This ain't a heartbreak anthem <br />

            A heartbreak anthem, a heartbreak anthem <br />
            (Ain't, ain't a heartbreak)</p>

        <p>Hello, it's me your ex (again) <br />
            I didn't wanna call but there's this pain in my chest <br />
             And thanks to you I'm wearing out this bulletproof vest <br />
            But I'll be okay (okay), I'm okay (I'm okay)</p>

        <p>Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don't (oh) <br />

            Until you find home</p>

        <p>This ain't a heartbreak anthem (no) <br />
            I don't care what happened <br />
            But I ain't got no time to dwell on it (oh) <br />
            Don't wanna throw a tantrum <br />
            You did what you had to <br />
            No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it <br />
            And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow <br />

            <h3 id="zona-3">Story of My Life</h3>
            <p><strong>One Direction</strong></p>
            <p> Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain <br />
                I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days <br />
                She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones <br />
                It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone</p>

            <p>And I'll be gone, gone tonight <br />
                The ground beneath my feet is open wide <br />
                The way that I been holdin' on too tight <br />
                With nothin' in between</p>

            <p>The story of my life, I take her home <br />
                I drive all night to keep her warm <br />
                And time is frozen (the story of, the story of) <br />
                The story of my life, I give her hope <br />
                I spend her love until she's broke inside <br />
                The story of my life (the story of, the story of)</p>

            <p>Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change <br />
                Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage <br />
                I know that in the morning, I'll see us in the light up on the hill <br />
                Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still</p>

            <p>And I'll be gone, gone tonight <br />
                The fire beneath my feet is burnin' bright <br />
                The way that I've been holdin' on so tight <br />
                With nothin' in between</p>

            <p>The story of my life, I take her home <br />
                I drive all night to keep her warm <br /> 
                And time is frozen (the story of, the story of) <br />
                The story of my life, I give her hope <br />
                I spend her love until she's broke inside <br />
                The story of my life (the story of, the story of)</p>

            <p>And I've been waiting for this time to come around <br />
                But, baby, runnin' after you is like chasin' the clouds</p>

            <p>The story of my life, I take her home <br />
                I drive all night to keep her warm <br />
                And time is frozen</p>

            <p>The story of my life, I give her hope (give her hope) <br />
